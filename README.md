> My journey through the C Piscine at 42 Bangkok â€” diving deep into low-level programming with the C language

## ðŸ§  About This Repository

In May 2025 piscine, I had the opportunity to participate in the **C Piscine** at [42 Bangkok](https://42bangkok.com), a 26-day intensive program focused on learning the fundamentals of programming through the C language, peer-to-peer learning, and project-based challenges â€” all without formal teachers.

This repository contains code, exercises, and small projects I completed during the Piscine. 
From writing basic functions to working with memory management and recursion,
this experience helped shape my understanding of low-level programming.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- Writing low-level code in C  
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving  
- Manual memory management  
- Collaborating with others in a peer-learning environment  
- Building resilience through trial and error
